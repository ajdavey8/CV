I am full stack junior developer, having graduated from Makers Academy in January 2018. I am looking for a role to continue learning and extend my knowledge of programming. I am enthusiastic to work on new projects and see them come to life.



**Tech Skills:** React, Node.js, Express, Mocha, Chai, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, JavaScript, Jasmine, jQuery, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Communication
Many of my previous roles have relied upon my communication skills, from being an English Tutor to Recruitment Consultant to working with fellow developers at Makers Academy. They have required me to interact with team members or clients in a range of different situations.

#### Initiative
After university, I decided to go to Rio de Janeiro where I had no contacts upon arrival. Due to my determination and motivation to succeed, after a couple of months I was able to establish myself as a self-employed English tutor with a network of students.

#### Fast learner
For our [final project](https://github.com/majdeddine/take-a-paws) at Makers Academy, I learnt Node.js, express and React without being taught on the course. Using it to build a fully functioning social search app in two weeks, implementing features from back-end to front-end.
