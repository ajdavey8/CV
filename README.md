I am a recent Makers graduate looking for a role where I am challenged constantly to better myself and where I am working with people who I can learn from. Programming allows me to challenge myself both logically - when coming up with a solution to a problem - and creatively - when figuring out an elegant solution to said problem. I love the idea of creating usable products and gain great satisfaction from the result and problem solving to get there.


**Tech Skills:** React, Node.js, Express, Mocha, Chai, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, JavaScript, Jasmine, jQuery, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Communication
Many of my previous roles have relied upon my communication skills, from being an English Tutor to Recruitment Consultant to working with fellow developers at Makers Academy. They have required me to interact with team members or clients in a range of different situations.

#### Initiative
After university, I decided to go to Rio de Janeiro where I had no contacts upon arrival. Due to my determination and motivation to succeed, after a couple of months I was able to establish myself as a self-employed English tutor with a network of students.

#### Fast learner
For our [final project](https://github.com/ajdavey8/take-a-paws) at Makers Academy, I learnt Node.js, express and React without being taught on the course. Using it to build a fully functioning social search app in two weeks, implementing features from back-end to front-end.
