I am full stack junior developer with ambition and enthusiasm to continue learning and extend my knowledge of programming.



**Tech Skills:** Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, JavaScript, Jasmine, jQuery, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Communication
Many of my previous roles have relied upon my communication skills, from being an English Tutor to Recruitment Consultant to working with fellow developers at Makers Academy. They have required me to interact with team members or clients in a range of different situations.

#### Initiative
After university, I decided to go to Rio de Janeiro where I had no contacts upon arrival. Due to my determination and motivation to succeed, after a couple of months I was able to establish myself as a self-employed English tutor with a network of students.
